Begin building out the project defined in @plan.md
# Every iteration, be sure to update the @current_status.md document to capture our place in the development cycle
# When errors are encountered, document them and their resolution in @errors_resolutions.md if multiple attempts to fix take place, be sure to collect all attempts, the new reasoning, and ultimately the final resolution.

# NOTE: pay close attention to directory structure, @plan.md is located in the project root. Any bootstrapping that takes place should understand where root is, and where any client / serverside applications are.

# IMPORTANT: record achievements in @current_status.md
# IMPORTANT: @current_status.md is append only
# IMPORTANT: @errors_resolutions.md is append only
# IMPORTANT: @plan.md is read only
# IMPORTANT: @instructions.md is read only

# IMPORTANT: every iteration we should be able to run our application and have it work based on the stage of the project. Deliver Value every iteration.
