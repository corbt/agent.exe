## Iteration 6: User Feedback and Continuous Input System

1. Designed the continuous input data structure
2. Updated `src/main/store/types.ts` to include new types for user input
3. Modified `src/main/store/create.ts` to handle continuous user input in the store
4. Created a new `ContinuousInput` component in `src/renderer/ContinuousInput.tsx`
5. Updated `src/renderer/App.tsx` to include the new ContinuousInput component
6. Modified `src/main/store/runAgent.ts` to check for and incorporate new user inputs
7. Implemented the mechanism to add new user inputs to the message stack
8. Integrated the new input system with the existing run history
9. Fixed issues related to incorrect message roles and API compatibility:
   - Updated `runAgent` function to filter out 'tool' role messages before sending to API
   - Ensured tool use and results are included as part of 'assistant' messages
   - Updated `AppMessage` type to only allow 'user' and 'assistant' roles
10. Corrected the return format in the `promptForAction` function to match expected `BetaMessageParam` type
11. Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the application
12. Next steps:
    - Conduct thorough testing of the continuous input functionality
    - Ensure the AI can properly respond to and incorporate new instructions
    - Refine error handling and user feedback mechanisms
    - Move on to the next enhancement: Plugin System

## Iteration 7: Refinement and Testing

2. Updated the textarea component to use `flex: 1` instead of a fixed height
3. Removed manual resizing functionality for the instructions box
4. Adjusted the layout to accommodate the expanded instructions box
5. Next steps:
   - Test the expanded instructions input box functionality
   - Ensure proper layout and scrolling behavior with the new design
   - Address any potential conflicts with other components (e.g., run history, error messages)
   - Continue with the implementation of the Plugin System

## Iteration 10: Plugin System Implementation

1. Created `src/main/pluginManager.ts` to handle plugin loading and management
